## Client Module

---

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the `/client` directory, you can run:

#### `npm run start`

Runs RWBI's client module in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm run build`

Builds RWBI's client module for production to the `/api/dist` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The built client module will be loaded by the server module in the `/api` directory, and will be accessible at `http://localhost:8080/`
